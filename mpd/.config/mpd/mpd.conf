# Files and directories
#
# This setting controls the top directory which MPD will search to discover the
# available audio files and add them to the daemon's online database. This
# setting defaults to the XDG directory, otherwise the music directory will be
# be disabled and audio files will only be accepted over ipc socket (using
# file:// protocol) or streaming files over an accepted protocol.
#
music_directory     "~/Music"
#
# This setting sets the MPD internal playlist directory. The purpose of this
# directory is storage for playlists created by MPD. The server will use
# playlist files not created by the server but only if they are in the MPD
# format. This setting defaults to playlist saving being disabled.
#
playlist_directory  "~/.local/share/mpd/playlists"
#
# This setting sets the location of the MPD database. This file is used to
# load the database at server start up and store the database while the
# server is not up. This setting defaults to disabled which will allow
# MPD to accept files over ipc socket (using file:// protocol) or streaming
# files over an accepted protocol.
#
db_file             "~/.local/share/mpd/database"

# These settings are the locations for the daemon log files for the daemon.
#
# The special value "syslog" makes MPD use the local syslog daemon. This
# setting defaults to logging to syslog.
#
# If you use systemd, do not configure a log_file.  With systemd, MPD
# defaults to the systemd journal, which is fine.
#
log_file			"~/.local/share/mpd/log.txt"

# This setting sets the location of the file which stores the process ID
# for use of mpd --kill and some init scripts. This setting is disabled by
# default and the pid file will not be stored.
#
# If you use systemd, do not configure a pid_file.
#
pid_file			"~/.local/share/mpd/pid"

# This setting sets the location of the file which contains information about
# most variables to get MPD back into the same general shape it was in before
# it was brought down. This setting is disabled by default and the server
# state will be reset on server start up.
#
state_file			"~/.local/share/mpd/state"

# This setting sets the address for the daemon to listen on. Careful attention
# should be paid if this is assigned to anything other than the default, any.
# This setting can deny access to control of the daemon. Not effective if
# systemd socket activation is in use.
#
# For network
bind_to_address		"localhost"
#
# And for Unix Socket
#bind_to_address		"~/.mpd/socket"

# This setting is the TCP port that is desired for the daemon to get assigned
# to.
#
port				"6600"

# Suppress all messages below the given threshold.  Use "verbose" for
# troubleshooting. Available setting arguments are "notice", "info", "verbose",
# "warning" and "error".
#
#log_level			"notice"
#
# Setting "restore_paused" to "yes" puts MPD into pause mode instead
# of starting playback after startup.
#
restore_paused      "yes"
